# 1.
pi = 3.1415926
# pi = int(pi)
print((4 / 3) * pi * 5 ** 3)
# if int is added, the answer would be 500, which makes pi equal to 3
# when do we need int() and when not? the number assigned to variables is integer but the input must be string right?

# 2.
x = 60
print(24.95 * 0.6 * x + 3 + 0.75 * (x - 1))

# 3.
